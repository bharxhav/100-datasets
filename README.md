# 100-datasets

__NOTE__ (to any recruiter coming from my resume): Due to final semester-exams, I will have to finish this project after Dec 19. Wish me luck!

## Why?
<!-- - I need a __Data Science__ Job. -->
<!-- - I need to _showcase_ my diverse range of expertise. -->
<!-- - I also need one link _show-it-all_ project. -->

To learn intricacies of ML. ML is not a statistical method when dealing with data. I see it as a means to get some result through methodical data morphology. Results and my inference is what makes a good data analysis. To ensure that I am able to see through ML well enough that I can focus in honing inferential skills. I am developing this project.

To gain such experience I must be able to learn from 100s of datasets. This is just a boosted attempt to hack my way there.
